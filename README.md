Here's the README adapted for Toolhouse:

# Toolhouse Cookbook

The Toolhouse Cookbook provides code and guides designed to help developers build with AI function calling, offering copy-able code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll need a Toolhouse account (sign up for free [here](https://www.toolhouse.com)).

While the code examples are primarily written in Python, the concepts can be adapted to any programming language that supports interaction with the Toolhouse API.

If you're new to working with the Toolhouse API, we recommend starting with our [Toolhouse API Fundamentals course](https://github.com/toolhouse/courses/tree/master/toolhouse_api_fundamentals) to get a solid foundation.
