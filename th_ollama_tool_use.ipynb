       "   - This webpage explores the \"experiential\" seasons of New York City, going beyond typical astrological or meteorological definitions. It defines 12 unique seasons based on a combination of the day of the year, the time of day, and the real-time temperature in NYC. The website dynamically updates to reflect the current season. The author uses historical temperature data from 1979 to 2023 to determine these seasons. The webpage is based on a popular meme and is intended to be a playful, but thorough, exploration of the unique weather patterns and experiences of New York City.</pre>"
